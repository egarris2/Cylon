# Cylon
Development board with an ESP32-s3-wroom-1 wifi module and a row of addressable LEDs.

This project was made for using the one click PCBA fabrication through JLCPCB. Just open the project in easyEDA STD editor, then click on the fabrication menu and select one-click order PCB/SMT to order the board. 

I ordered 10 for around 100 dollars after I checked standard(not economic) assembly so JLC would populate the LEDs and Wifi module. 


The code is a combination of following an online tutorial for controlling an LED using a webserver and the blink ESP-IDF example project. These can be found in the programming section of the quick-start guide.
