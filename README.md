This project was made for using the one click PCBA fabrication through JLCPCB. Just open the project in easyEDA STD editor, then click on the fabrication menu and select one-click order PCB/SMT to order the board. 

I ordered 10 for around 100 dollars after I checked standard(not economic) assembly so JLC would populate the LEDs and Wifi module.
